# Architecture

## Purpose

`github.com/Trysac/u257-k8s-manifest-security` is a small, dependency-free Go library: Check Kubernetes workload manifests against Pod Security Standards baseline and restricted controls plus image and memory limit hygiene, with exact field paths and stable rule codes

## Shape

```text
caller code --> package k8smanifestsecurity (repository root)
                    |
                    +-- pure functions, no I/O, no global mutable state
                    +-- internal/ (optional private helpers)
```

- **Public API**: every exported identifier of the root package. Unexported identifiers and
  `internal/` packages may change without a major version.
- **Errors**: invalid input returns an error; exported sentinel errors (such as `ErrBlank`) let
  callers branch with `errors.Is`. The library never panics on input, prints or exits.
- **Side effects**: none. If a feature needs I/O, accept an interface (`io.Reader` or a small
  custom one) instead of opening resources, and record the choice in an ADR.

## Quality contract

`scripts/check` is the single definition of the gates; `fabrica.json` tells the factory and CI
how to run it. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

## Decisions

Architecture decisions are recorded in [decisions/](decisions/) as numbered ADRs.
